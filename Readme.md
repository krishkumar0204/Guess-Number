## Guess Number Game

This is a simple Guess the Number game that I created. The program picks a secret number, and the player’s task is to guess it within the fewest attempts possible. After each guess, the game gives hints like “too high” or “too low” until the correct number is found. It’s a fun way to test your luck and logic!
